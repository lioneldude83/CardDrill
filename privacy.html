    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: August 20, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Card Drill is a flashcard-based study app designed to help users learn and review material more effectively. 
        Your privacy is important, and this policy explains how the app handles your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Card Drill does not collect any personal information from users. The app uses Apple’s CloudKit to store user data, such as flashcard decks and progress, securely in your private iCloud account.
    </p>

    <h2>Developer Data Access</h2>
    <p>
        As the developer, I do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. All user content remains private and is only accessible by you.
    </p>

    <h2>CloudKit and iCloud</h2>
    <p>
        Card Drill stores your flashcards and related content in your personal iCloud account using CloudKit. This ensures your data stays in sync across your Apple devices. Data is stored in your private iCloud container and is not shared with the developer or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Premium Features</h2>
    <p>
        Card Drill offers an optional Pro subscription that unlocks additional features. All transactions are processed securely via Apple’s App Store infrastructure. No payment information is ever stored or accessed by the app or its developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        Card Drill does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks. Your app usage is not monitored or profiled.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
